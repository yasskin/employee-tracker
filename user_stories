Employee Tracker
Build an app for a company to help track employees and the current projects they're assigned.

As an HR manager, I want to be able to create divisions in the company (HR, IT, Sales, etc).
As an HR manager, I want to be able to list, update, and delete divisions.
As an HR manager, I want to be able to add employees and assign them to a division. An employee will belong to one division and a division will have many employees.
As an HR manager, I want to be able to choose an individual division and see its employees.
If you finish the previous requirements, you are well on your way to understanding Active Record!

Here are a few more user stories to consider for the Employee Tracker:

As a project manager, I want to be able to add projects.
As a project manager, I want to be able to list the current projects.
As a project manager, I want to be able to assign a project to an employee when I am looking at the project page.
As a project manager, I want to be able to assign an employee a project when I am looking at the employee page.
As a project manager, I want to be able to remove employees from projects when their part is completed or they have moved on.
As a project manager, I want to be able to update which project an employee is working on.
As a project manager, I want to see all of the employees on a given project.
For this app, a project has many employees but an employee is assigned to one project at a time.

Think about the HR Manager, Project Manager and employees. Are there other user stories to develop?
